## 1. 🧐 Understanding _Truthy_ and _Falsy_ in JavaScript

### ✅ Primitive Types

- 💡 Represent single, immutable values. Primitive types in JavaScript include `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `symbol`, and `BigInt`.

- 💡 If a primitive type has a value that is considered falsy (like `0`, `false`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, or `NaN`), it will behave as false in a Boolean context.

- 💡 They are stored directly in the location where the variable accesses them.

### ✅ Reference Types

- 💡 Include objects such as `function`, `array`, and other `objects`, and they are mutable.

- 💡 When you create a reference type, JavaScript allocates memory for it and the variable you assign it to holds a reference (or pointer) to that memory space, not the actual data itself.

- 💡 Since a reference points to an object, and objects in JavaScript are inherently truthy, a reference type cannot be falsy. Even if an object is empty (like `{}`) or an array has no elements (`[]`), it is still truthy because a reference to an allocated memory space exists.

### 🤔 Why are Function Constructors Truthy?

- 💡 Function constructors like `new Number()` or `new Boolean()` create object wrappers around primitive values.

- 💡 Despite the primitive value inside the object being falsy (like `0` or `false`), the object wrapper itself is a reference type.

- 💡 As we’ve established, reference types are always truthy because they refer to a memory location, not the value itself.

### ✨ Simple Analogy: Folder-Paper

Think of primitive types as individual pieces of paper with something written on them. If the paper is blank (a falsy value), it’s like having nothing or false. Reference types, on the other hand, are like folders (objects) that can hold these papers. Even if the folder is designed to hold a blank paper, the folder itself still exists and is something (truthy). The function constructors like `new Number()` and `new Boolean()` are like special folders that come with a label and even if the label says `0` or `false` (falsy), the folder is still an item you can reference and use (truthy).

🧠 Remember, in JavaScript, the type of value determines its **truthiness** or **falsiness**. Objects will always be your go-to for a guaranteed truthy value!

## 2. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Understanding Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript

In JavaScript, a `prototype` is like a blueprint for creating objects. It’s an object itself, and every function in JavaScript has a prototype property that’s used when creating new objects. This prototype object includes properties and methods that should be available to the objects created from the function.

### 💡Simple Analogy: Recipe for a Cake

Imagine you have a recipe for a cake. This recipe includes all the steps and ingredients you need to make the cake. In JavaScript, the recipe is like the `prototype`. When you bake a cake using this recipe, the cake (an `object`) inherits all the properties from the recipe (the `prototype`). If you decide to add a new step to the recipe, like adding icing, all the cakes made from that recipe will now have icing too.

> ℹ️ Similarly, when you create an object from a constructor function in JavaScript, the object inherits all the properties and methods from the constructor’s prototype. This allows all objects created from the same constructor to share the same properties and methods, which can save memory and allow for a consistent structure.
>
> ℹ️ So, prototypal inheritance is a way objects in JavaScript can inherit properties and methods from a prototype, much like how multiple cakes can be made from the same recipe. But if a properties/methods is removed from the prototype, all objects that inherit from that prototype lose access to that properties/methods.

### 📝 Handle with Care

While it’s tempting to keep adding to prototypes, it’s generally not recommended because it can lead to unexpected behavior in code, especially if libraries or frameworks are used that might also modify the prototype. Remember that with great power comes great responsibility. 🙂

### 🎓 The Takeaway

Prototypal inheritance is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows objects to share and extend behaviors efficiently. It’s what makes JavaScript dynamic and flexible, enabling us to write more reusable and maintainable code. 💪

✨ So, the next time you’re working with JavaScript objects, remember the family tree of prototypes and how it empowers your code with shared DNA. 🧬

**🧠 Now that we have basic understanding, lets go through the following examples.**

---

**Example: Barking Dog**

```jsx
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
  console.log(`Woof I am ${this.name}`);
};

const pet = new Dog("Mara");

pet.bark(); // Outputs: Woof I am Mara
```

**Explanation:** A `Dog` class is created with a constructor to assign the name to the dog. A method `bark` is added to `Dog`’s prototype, which allows all instances of `Dog` to use this method. A new instance of `Dog` named ‘Mara’ is created, and `pet.bark()` is called, which outputs “Woof I am Mara”.

**Example: String.prototype**

```jsx
// Adding a method to String.prototype
String.prototype.shout = function () {
  return this.toUpperCase() + "!!!";
};

let greeting = "hello";
console.log(greeting.shout()); // Outputs: HELLO!!!
```

**Explanation:** Here, we add a method called `shout` to `String.prototype`. This means every string created in JavaScript will now have access to this `shout` method. The method converts the string to uppercase and adds exclamation marks.

**Example: Array.prototype**

```jsx
// Adding a method to Array.prototype
Array.prototype.firstElement = function () {
  return this.length > 0 ? this[0] : undefined;
};

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(numbers.firstElement()); // Outputs: 1
```

**Explanation:** We add a method called `firstElement` to `Array.prototype`. This method returns the first element of an array if it exists. Now, any array we create will have this `firstElement` method available.

**Example: Object.prototype**

```jsx
// Adding a method to Object.prototype
Object.prototype.keysCount = function () {
  return Object.keys(this).length;
};

let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(person.keysCount()); // Outputs: 2
```

**Explanation:** we add a method called `keysCount` to `Object.prototype`. This method returns the number of keys (properties) in an object. By adding this method to `Object.prototype`, every object created in JavaScript, including `person`, now has access to the `keysCount` method. When we call `person.keysCount()`, it outputs `2` because there are two keys in the `person` object: `name` and `age`.

## 3. 🤝 What Are Promises in JavaScript?

A promise is a special JavaScript object that connects the “_producing code_” (which performs an asynchronous operation) with the “_consuming code_” (which handles the result of that operation). Think of it as a subscription list: the promise ensures that the result will be available to all subscribed code when it’s ready.

### ✨ Simple Analogy: Restaurant Reservation

Imagine you’re making a reservation at a restaurant for your niece’s birthday party next week. When you make the reservation, the restaurant gives you a promise that a table will be available for you at the specified time. In this analogy:

- **👉 Producing code:** The restaurant staff (like a waiter) takes whatever time they need to prepare the table (the promised result).

- **👉 Promise:** The reservation itself acts as the promise. It ensures that the table will be ready for your party when you arrive.

### 🧩 Key concepts of promises

1. **States of a Promise:**

   - **👉 Pending:** The promise is awaiting a response (like waiting for the table to be set).

   - **👉 Resolved (Fulfilled):** The promise has successfully returned a value (like when the table is ready).

   - **👉 Rejected:** The promise encountered an error (like when the restaurant couldn’t accommodate your reservation).

2. **Creating a Promise in JavaScript:**

   - 👉 You can create a promise using the ”Promise” constructor. It takes a callback function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`

   - 👉 Inside the callback, you perform your asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data, loading an image, etc.).

   - 👉 If everything goes well, you call `resolve` with the result. If there’s an error, you call `reject` with an error message.

🧠 Remember, promises allow you to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly, making your code cleaner and easier to reason about. Just like a restaurant reservation, they ensure that the result will be available when needed! 🍽️

**🕹️ Now that we have basic understanding, lets go through the following examples.**

---

**Example: creating and using a promise**

```jsx
// Creating a promise
const reservationPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data)
  const condition = true;

  if (condition) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Stuff worked!";
      resolve(data); // Resolve the promise;
    }, 2000); // Simulating a delay
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject(Error("Promise is rejected.")); // Reject the promise;
    }, 2000); // Simulating a delay
  }
});

// Consuming the promise
reservationPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Promise worked!", result); // Handle success
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("Something went wrong!", err.message); // Handle error
  });
```

**Explanation:**

- We create a promise `reservationPromise` that `resolves`/`reject` based on the condition after a 2-second delay.
- If `condition` is `true`, it logs `Promise worked! Stuff worked!` to the console.
- If `condition` is `false`,  it logs `Something went wrong! Promise is rejected`. (you can customize the error message).

---

**Example: using `async`/`await` with Fetch API**

```jsx
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
    if (response.status === 200) {
      const data = await response.json(); // Await the JSON parsing
      return data;
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Error fetching data. Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
    // Handle the error gracefully (e.g., show a user-friendly message)
    return null;
  }
}

// Usage
try {
  const result = await getData();
  if (result && result.length > 0) {
    console.log("Data received:", result);
  } else {
    console.log("Failed to fetch data.");
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred during data retrieval:", error.message);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `getData` function is defined as an **async function**. This means it always returns a **promise**.
- We use `await` directly in the `getData()` function to wait for the `fetch` request to complete and handle the response.
- If the response status is 200, we parse the JSON data.
- If there’s an error (e.g., non-200 status or network issues), we throw an error and catch it in the `try`/`catch` block.
- The usage section demonstrates how to call the `getData()` function and handle the result or error.

## 4. 🗃️ What Are Closures in JavaScript?

A closure is a fundamental concept in JavaScript. It occurs when a function _remembers_ its lexical scope even after it has finished executing. In simpler terms, a closure allows a function to retain access to variables from its _outer (enclosing) function_, even when that outer function has completed execution.

### 🧩 Simple Analogy: The Picnic Basket

Imagine you’re going on a picnic with friends. You pack a picnic basket with all the essentials: sandwiches, fruits, drinks, and utensils. As you head to the park, you carry the basket with you. Now, here’s the interesting part: the basket itself is like a closure!

**❇️ The Basket (Closure):**

- ✨ The picnic basket encapsulates everything you need for the picnic.
- ✨ It **closes over** its contents, keeping them private and secure.
- ✨ Similarly, a closure in JavaScript encapsulates variables and functions within a specific context.

**🔥 How Do Closures Work?**

1. **ℹ️ Lexical Scope:**
   - ✨ JavaScript uses lexical scoping, which means that functions have access to variables defined in their containing (parent) functions.
   - ✨ When a function is defined, it _captures_ its surrounding scope, creating a closure.
2. **ℹ️ Creating a Closure:** A closure is formed when:
   - ✨ An inner function is defined within an outer function.
   - ✨ The inner function references variables from the outer function.
   - ✨ The inner function is returned or passed as an argument to other functions.

### 🔥 Use Cases and Benefits

- **ℹ️ Data Privacy:**
  - ✨ By enclosing variables within a closure, you create private variables.
  - ✨ These variables are accessible only within the closure’s scope, providing data privacy.
  - ✨ This approach emulates private methods in object-oriented programming.
- **ℹ️ Function Factories:**
  - ✨ You can generate specialized functions (function factories) using closures. For instance, consider a function that generates related functions based on an initial value.
- **ℹ️ Event Handling:**
  - ✨ When you attach an event handler (like a click event) to an HTML element, you’re creating a closure.
  - ✨ The event handler function _remembers_ the surrounding context (variables, functions) - even after it’s detached from the element.
- **ℹ️ Timeouts and Intervals:**
  - ✨ Closures are essential for managing timeouts and intervals, `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.
  - ✨ They ensure that the correct context is maintained when the callback executes.

**🕹️ Now that we have the understanding, lets go through the following examples.**

---

**Example: Data Privacy**

```jsx
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count += 1;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
// 'count' is not accessible from outside the 'createCounter' function.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `createCounter` function encapsulates a `count` variable. It returns an anonymous function that, when called, increments `count` and returns its value.
- The `count` variable is private and cannot be accessed or modified directly outside of `createCounter`.

---

**Example: Function Factories**

```jsx
function makeMultiplier(multiplier) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * multiplier;
  };
}

const double = makeMultiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

**Explanation:**

- The `makeMultiplier` function takes a `multiplier` argument and returns a new function. This returned function takes a `number` argument and returns the product of `number` and `multiplier`.
- Each function created by `makeMultiplier` retains its own `multiplier` value.

---

**Example: Event Handling**

```jsx
let countClicks = (function () {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count += 1;
    console.log(`Button clicked ${count} times`);
  };
})();

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", countClicks);
```

**Explanation:**

- The `countClicks` IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) creates a private `count` variable for counting clicks.
- The returned function is used as an event handler for clicks, which increments the count and logs it to the console.

---

**Example: Timeouts and Intervals**

```jsx
function delayedAlert(message, delay) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    alert(message);
  }, delay);
}

delayedAlert("Hello after 2 seconds", 2000);
```

**Explanation:**

- The `delayedAlert` function demonstrates a closure where the `message` and `delay` parameters are used by the anonymous function inside the `setTimeout`.
- Even after `delayedAlert` has finished executing, the callback function can still access the `message` and `delay`.

## 5. 🔄 Understanding event loop and asynchronous behavior in JavaScript

JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it processes one task at a time. However, it can handle asynchronous tasks efficiently using an event loop. Here’s how it works:

### 1️⃣ Main Thread

- When you run JavaScript code, it executes on the main thread.
- Any synchronous code (like function calls, assignments, or loops) runs sequentially.

### 2️⃣ Asynchronous Tasks

- Asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching data from an API, reading files, or waiting for user input) don’t block the main thread.
- These tasks are delegated to the browser’s `Web API`s (like setTimeout, fetch, or addEventListener).
- While waiting for the result, the main thread continues executing other code.

### 3️⃣ Callback Queue

- When an asynchronous task completes, it places its callback (a function to execute) in the callback queue.
- The callback queue holds functions waiting to be executed.

### 4️⃣ Event Loop

The event loop continuously checks:

- Is the call stack (where functions execute) empty?
- Is there anything in the callback queue?
- If the call stack is empty, the event loop picks the next callback from the queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

### ⏱️ Web APIs and `setTimeout` Execution

**1️⃣ `setTimeout` Execution**

- JavaScript can access Web APIs (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`, `addEventListener`). These are asynchronous and run in parallel with other operations.
- When you call setTimeout(callback, delay), it schedules the callback function to run after the specified delay.
- The browser delegates this task to a Web API (outside the JavaScript engine).
- The main thread continues executing other code while waiting for the delay.
- After the delay, the callback is placed in the callback queue.

**2️⃣ Event Loop**

The event loop continuously checks:

- Is the call stack (where functions execute) empty?
- Is there anything in the callback queue?
- If the call stack is empty, the event loop picks the next callback from the queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

### 🤝 Microtask Queue and `Promises` Execution

Promises handle asynchronous operations more elegantly:

**1️⃣ `Promise` Execution:**

- A promise represents a value that may not be available yet (e.g., data from an API).
- When a promise resolves (or rejects), it schedules its callback (.then() or .catch()) to run.
- Promises use the `microtask queue` (higher priority than the callback queue).

**2️⃣ Event Loop and Microtasks:**

- After executing the current task (e.g., a synchronous function), the event loop checks the microtask queue.
- If there are resolved promises waiting, their callbacks are executed.
- This ensures that promises are handled before the next task from the callback queue.

📝 In summary, `setTimeout` uses the `callback queue`, while promises use the `microtask queue`. The event loop manages both, ensuring efficient handling of asynchronous tasks! 🔁
Remember, the event loop ensures that asynchronous tasks don’t block the main thread, allowing your application to remain responsive even during time-consuming operations! 💪

**🕹️ Now that we have the understanding, lets go through the following examples.**

---

**Example: `setTimeout`**

```jsx
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 1000);
console.log("End");

// Output:
/* 
'Start'
'End'
(After 1 second) 'Timeout callback' 
*/
```

**Explanation:**

- `Start` and `End` execute synchronously.
- The `setTimeout` callback is scheduled to run after 1 second, but it doesn’t block the main thread.

1. Initial Execution:

   - The `console.log('Start')` statement runs first, printing `Start`.
   - Next, the `setTimeout` function is called, which schedules the callback function to run after 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
   - Finally, the `console.log('End')` statement executes, printing `End`.

2. Event Loop and Web APIs:

   - The `setTimeout` callback is asynchronous and gets delegated to the Web APIs.
   - The main thread is free to continue executing other code.

3. Timeout Completion:

   - After 1 second, the Web APIs signal that the timeout has completed.
   - The callback (`console.log('Timeout callback')`) is placed in the callback queue.

4. Callback Queue and Event Loop:

   - The event loop checks if the call stack is empty.
   - Since it is, the callback is moved from the queue to the call stack.
   - The callback executes, printing `Timeout callback`.

5. Final Output Order:
   - `Start`
   - `End`
   - (After 1 second) `Timeout callback`

---

**Example: `Promise`**

```jsx
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched"), 1000);
  });
};

fetchData().then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
console.log("Fetching data...");

// Output:
/* 
'Fetching data...'
(After 1 second) 'Data fetched'
*/
```

**Explanation:**

- `fetchData` returns a promise that resolves after 1 second.
- The `.then()` callback waits for the promise to resolve.
- Meanwhile, the main thread continues executing `Fetching data...`.

1. Initial Execution:

   - The `fetchData` function returns a promise.
   - The `console.log("Fetching data...")` statement runs, printing `Fetching data...`.

2. Promise Execution:

   - The promise resolves after 1 second (due to the `setTimeout`).
   - The resolved value (`Data fetched`) is placed in the callback queue.

3. Callback Queue and Event Loop:

   - The event loop checks if the call stack is empty.
   - It moves the `.then()` callback to the call stack.
   - The callback executes, printing `Data fetched`.

4. Final Output Order:
   - `Fetching data...`
   - (After 1 second) `Data fetched`

## 6. 🔥 Why `this` in JavaScript Can Be Confusing (And How to Master It)

- ✅ Implicit vs. Explicit Binding <br>
- ✅ Arrow Functions and Lexical `this` <br>
- ✅ Common Pitfalls and Fixes <br>

### 💡 Simple Analogy: A Personal Assistant with Multiple Bosses

Imagine an assistant who works for different bosses depending on the situation. Sometimes, they know exactly who to report to, but in tricky cases, they might get confused. **Similarly `this` refers to different objects depending on how and where a function is called**.

### 🔍 Understanding `this` in Different Contexts

**📝 Example 1: Implicit Binding (How `this` Works Inside an Object Method)**

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
```

**💡 Explanation:**

Since `this` is inside the greet method, it correctly refers to the `person` object.

**📝 Example 2: Explicit Binding with `call`, `apply`, and `bind`**

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
}

const user = { name: "John" };

sayHello.call(user); // Outputs: Hello, my name is John
```

**💡 Explanation:**

We explicitly define `this` using `.call()`, making sure it refers to `user`.

**📌 Common Mistake:**

Forgetting to bind this properly inside event listeners or callbacks can lead to errors!

**📝 Example 3: Arrow Functions and Lexical `this`**

```javascript
const student = {
  name: "Emma",
  subjects: ["Math", "Science"],
  showSubjects() {
    this.subjects.forEach((subject) => console.log(`${this.name} studies ${subject}`));
  },
};

student.showSubjects();
// Outputs: Emma studies Math
// Emma studies Science
```

**💡 Explanation:**

Arrow functions **do not** have their own `this`, so they inherit it from their surrounding function (`showSubjects`).

### 📌 Where You’ll See This in the Real World

- Debugging why `this` is `undefined` inside callbacks
- Ensuring correct `this` binding for class methods
- Fixing unexpected behavior in event listeners

## 7. 💡 `call`, `apply`, and `bind`: The Superpowers of JavaScript Functions

- ✅ Borrowing Methods from Other Objects
- ✅ Key Differences Between Them
- ✅ Real-World Applications

### 💡 Simple Analogy: Borrowing Someone's Car

Imagine your friend owns a car, but you need to drive it.

- `call` lets you drive it immediately.
- `apply` works the same, but asks you to list passengers in an array (arguments).
- `bind` hands you the keys, but you can drive whenever you want.

### 🔍 Understanding How These Methods Work

**📝 Example 1: Using `call` to Invoke a Function with a Custom Context**

```javascript
const person1 = { name: "Alice" };
const person2 = { name: "Bob" };

function introduce(age) {
  console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
}

introduce.call(person1, 25); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 25 years old.
introduce.call(person2, 30); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Bob and I'm 30 years old.
```

**💡 Explanation:** `.call()` lets us execute the function immediately while assigning `this` to `person1` or `person2`.

**📝 Example 2: Using `apply` to Pass Arguments as an Array**

```javascript
introduce.apply(person1, [25]); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 25 years old.
introduce.apply(person2, [30]); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Bob and I'm 30 years old.
```

**💡 Explanation:** `.apply()` works the same as `.call()`, but requires arguments in an array.

**📝 Example 3: Using `bind` to Return a New Function**

```javascript
const boundFunction = introduce.bind(person1, 28);
boundFunction(); // Outputs: Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 28 years old.
```

**💡 Explanation:** `.bind()` doesn't execute immediately—it creates a new function that remembers `this`.

- Borrowing array methods for objects
- Setting event listeners while preserving `this`
- Ensuring correct `this` binding inside asynchronous functions

## 8. 🚀 `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` Explained Like You’re Five

- ✅ Transforming Data in Arrays
- ✅ When and How to Use Them
- ✅ Multiple Real-Life Examples

### 💡 Simple Analogy: Sorting Clothes

Imagine you’re organizing a pile of clothes:

- `map` irons all items neatly.
- `filter` removes worn-out pieces.
- `reduce` folds everything into a neat bundle.

### 🔍 Understanding Each Method

**📝 Example 1: Using `map` to Modify Items in an Array**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Outputs: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**💡 Explanation:** Each item in the array is transformed without changing the original array.

**📝 Example 2: Filtering Specific Values**

```javascript
const ages = [12, 20, 17, 25, 30];

const adults = ages.filter((age) => age >= 18);
console.log(adults); // Outputs: [20, 25, 30]
```

**💡 Explanation:** `filter` removes values that don’t match the condition.

**📝 Example 3: Using `reduce` to Sum Up Values**

```javascript
const prices = [10, 20, 30, 40];

const totalPrice = prices.reduce((total, price) => total + price, 0);
console.log(totalPrice); // Outputs: 100
```

**💡 Explanation:** `reduce` starts at zero, then adds each item.

### 📌 Where You’ll See This in the Real World

- Modifying and transforming data in APIs
- Filtering user lists based on conditions
- Summing up totals in e-commerce applications

## 9. ⏳ How `setTimeout` and `setInterval` Work in JavaScript (And Why They Matter)

- ✅ Scheduling Tasks Like a Pro
- ✅ Understanding Web APIs and Delayed Execution
- ✅ Clearing Timers with `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval`

### 💡 Simple Analogy: Alarm Clock vs. Recurring Notifications

- `setTimeout` acts like an alarm—it rings once after a delay.
- `setInterval` behaves like recurring notifications—it rings repeatedly at set intervals.

### 🔍 Understanding How Each Works

**📝 Example 1: Using `setTimeout` to Delay Execution**

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello after 2 seconds"), 2000);
```

**💡 Explanation:** The function inside `setTimeout` waits for 2 seconds before executing, allowing other code to continue running in the meantime.

**📝 Example 2: Using `setInterval` to Run a Function Repeatedly**

```javascript
let counter = 0;

const interval = setInterval(() => {
  counter++;
  console.log(`Count: ${counter}`);
  if (counter === 5) clearInterval(interval); // Stop after 5 repetitions
}, 1000);
```

**💡 Explanation:** `setInterval` runs every second until `counter` reaches 5, at which point we call `clearInterval()` to stop it.

### 📌 Where You’ll See This in the Real World

- **Countdown timers** (e.g., auction bidding, flash sales)
- **Auto-refreshing notification**s (e.g., live sports scores)
- **Delayed animations** (e.g., showing tooltips after hovering)

## 10. 🔄 `async` and `await`: The Easiest Way to Handle Promises

- ✅ Say Goodbye to Callback Hell
- ✅ Writing Clean, Maintainable Asynchronous Code
- ✅ Handling Errors in Async Functions

### 💡 Simple Analogy: Ordering Food Online

You place an order at a restaurant (**promise**) and wait (**await**) for your food before eating.

### 🔍 Understanding Asynchronous Behavior

**📝 Example 1: Basic async and await Usage**

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
  let data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```

**💡 Explanation:** `await` **pauses execution until the fetch request completes**, ensuring we don’t access `data` before it’s available.

**📝 Example 2: Handling Errors in Async Code**

```javascript
async function fetchUserData() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch("https://invalid-url.com");
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error fetching data:", error.message);
  }
}

fetchUserData();
```

**💡 Explanation:** Wrapping code inside `try...catch` **prevents the entire script from breaking** if the request fails.

### 📌 Where You’ll See This in the Real World

- **Fetching data from APIs** (e.g., retrieving user profiles)
- **Handling authentication flows** (e.g., logging in users)
- **Waiting for animations to complete** (e.g., fading effects in UI)
